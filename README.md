# Cuthill-Mckee Reordering

Fortran module for (Reverse) Cuchil-Mckee Reordering.

An example comparison of the nodes before and after reordering:

## Usage

The [module file](./src/cuthill_mckee.f90) has no dependencies and can be integrated directly into your workflow. It contains the following functions:

Functions:

- `CM_from_list`: Returns a permutation vector as computed by the Cuthill-McKee algorithm, with a list of cell as argument
- `CM_from_connection`: Returns a permutation vector as computed by the Cuthill-McKee algorithm, with connection list as argument
- `CM_from_matrix`: Returns a permutation vector as computed by the Cuthill-McKee algorithm, with adjacency matrix as argument
- `reverse`: Returns the vector in reverse order. Use this for RCM.

By list of cell we mean a matrix, where the rows represent a cell (edge, triangle, square, etc.) and the columns represent the nodes that are forming the cell. For cells with more than 3 nodes, the node at index i should be connected to the nodes at indices i-1 and i+1.

By connection list we mean a matrix, where the rows represent a node and the columns represent the nodes that are connected to the node at the row index.

By adjacency matrix we mean a matrix, where the rows and columns represent the nodes of the graph and the values represent whether the nodes are connected or not. The matrix should be symmetric, with the diagonal being all zeros. The matrix is represented as a boolean matrix.
